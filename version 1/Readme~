You can test your code with a standard command line,  as follows:

cat FileName.csv | python map_1.py | python reduce_1.py

We will use Hadoop Streaming to execute our MapReduce scripts. In a terminal, type the following command:

hadoop jar /usr/hdp/current/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-streaming-2.7.3.2.5.0.0-1245.jar \
 -input /reddit/submissions.csv \
 -output /reddit-output \
 -mapper "python /root/hadoop/map.py" \
 -reducer "python /root/hadoop/reduce.py"
